# project3
This project is for CSC 2053. I used Python to scrape twitter from CEOs within the S&P 100 to compare their number of followers and total statuses to the compounding annual growth rate of their respective stocks. In addition, I created a Python program to upload GOOGLEFINANCE code to sheets in order to partially automate the process. I published my findings on my web portfolio found at http://webster.csc.villanova.edu/~plapro13/lab4/ under the CEO activisim tab. This project was made possible by using the google API and twitter developer API.
